# Markdown cheatsheet

## Link
```
[Title](link)
```
```
[Title](link, "link-title")
```
You can opptionally add a link-title that will appear as a tooltip.  

```
[Title](~/title.md#title, "link-title")
```
I think a link which ends with .md make a error.  
My solution is to add #title-something to end of a link.   
If somebody has a better solution, please let me know.    

## Code Block
